# Gemini Flash Models Comparison

## Overview

A comparison of Gemini Flash models shows trade-offs in speed, cost, and reasoning capability. The 2.5 models are an upgrade to the 2.0 versions. They primarily add a reasoning feature that is enabled by default on Flash, but optional on Flash-Lite.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary purpose** | Fast performance for everyday tasks, such as summarization, chat, and data extraction. | Highest cost efficiency and fastest performance for high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks. | Excellent price-to-performance ratio for large-scale processing, high-volume tasks, and advanced agentic use cases. | Most cost-efficient and fastest option in the 2.5 family, optimized for high throughput with low latency. |
| **Reasoning** | Lacks the native thinking capability of the 2.5 models. | Lacks the native thinking capability of the 2.5 models. | Enabled by default. Uses "thinking tokens" for enhanced performance on complex tasks. | Off by default. Can be enabled with an API parameter for complex tasks, adding "thinking tokens". |
| **Performance** | Strong performance for everyday tasks, improving on older versions. | Faster and more cost-efficient than Gemini 2.0 Flash. | Offers stronger performance and improved reasoning compared to Gemini 2.0 Flash. | Faster and delivers higher throughput and improved benchmarks compared to 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash. |
| **Cost (approx. per million tokens)** | Input: $0.10<br>Output: $0.40 | Input: $0.075<br>Output: $0.30 | Input: $0.30<br>Output: $2.50 | Input: $0.10<br>Output: $0.40 |
| **Token pricing consideration** | Reasoning is not billed. | Reasoning is not billed. | Costs more than non-thinking mode due to additional "thinking tokens" billed at the output rate. | Costs more than default mode when reasoning is enabled due to "thinking tokens" billed at the output rate. |
| **Key capabilities** | Tool use, multimodal generation (text output from multimodal input), 1M token context window. | Optimized for large-scale text output. Also offers tool use and a 1M token context window. | Multimodality, long context, and dynamic reasoning controls, including the "Deep Think" mode for complex problems. | Multimodality, long context, and tool use, with optional reasoning controls for balancing cost and performance. |
| **Ideal use cases** | Chatbots, summarization, data extraction, and general purpose applications. | High-volume tasks like classification and translation where cost and latency are critical. | Large-scale processing, complex agentic use cases, and applications requiring some reasoning but still prioritizing speed. | High-volume, cost-sensitive, and latency-critical tasks that require better quality but offer the flexibility to manage reasoning cost. |

## Key Takeaways

- **2.0 Models**: No native reasoning capability, lower cost, suitable for standard tasks
- **2.5 Models**: Built-in reasoning capability with "thinking tokens", higher performance on complex tasks
- **Flash vs Flash-Lite**: Flash-Lite prioritizes cost efficiency and speed, while Flash offers more balanced performance
- **Reasoning Toggle**: 2.5 Flash has reasoning on by default; 2.5 Flash-Lite allows optional activation for cost control
